The app does show up on the emulator but doesn't run correctly because the buttons take up 100% of the window
they are placed in.  So the whole app shows up as one big button that when clicked closes the whole app because of
the eventlistener on the second window.

Visually the colors make it kind of hard to look at,just my opinion I guess. and the text would look a lot better if it 
was sized and also if the text was positioned in way that made it seem like it was an actual business card which are minor fixes.

The app has no code for it to adapt to other devices a=on different operating systems,which i couldnt gigure out either. But since most of 
sizes are in percentages it shouldn't have too hard of a time adapting to a different sized screen once the navigation is fixed.
